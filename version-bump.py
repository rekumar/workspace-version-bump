"""
Pre-commit hook for automatic version bumping in UV workspace.

This script:
1. Analyzes git diff to identify changed packages based on specified package directories.
2. Checks if versions have been manually updated.
3. Auto-bumps patch version for packages with changes but no version bump, excluding ignored packages.
4. Bumps root version if any subpackages were bumped, using a configurable root pyproject.toml path.
